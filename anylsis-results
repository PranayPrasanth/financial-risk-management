Justification for using Parametric Approach

1. Normal Distribution of Returns:
The Shapiro-Wilk test results show that the returns of the stock are normally distributed with a high p-value (0.6848),
 meaning there is no significant deviation from normality. Since the parametric VaR approach assumes that the underlying
  returns are normally distributed, this test result supports the use of the parametric method.
2. Simplicity and Computational Efficiency:
The parametric VaR method is one of the simplest and most computationally efficient techniques to calculate risk. By
 using the mean and standard deviation of returns, it avoids the complexity of more advanced techniques (such as Monte
  Carlo simulation or historical simulation). This makes it particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, and
   where the returns are approximately normally distributed, as is the case here.
3. Theoretical Foundation:
The parametric VaR method is grounded in statistical theory, specifically under the assumption that financial returns
are normally distributed. Since your returns passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the theoretical assumption holds
 true, making the parametric approach an appropriate method for calculating risk in this scenario.
4. Risk Estimation:
The parametric approach provides an estimate of potential loss based on the mean, standard deviation, and the confidence
 level. These are key parameters in risk management, and the parametric method allows for a straightforward estimation
 of the risk of an asset or portfolio in normal market conditions. Given the normality of the returns, this method
  produces an accurate risk measure.
5. Interpretation of VaR:
The parametric VaR can be easily interpreted and is widely understood by risk managers. The calculation of VaR based on
a normal distribution allows for an intuitive understanding of risk—specifically, the potential loss in the worst case
scenario at a given confidence level. For example, at a 95% confidence level, the VaR tells us the amount we could lose
 with a 95% probability over a given time horizon. This helps investors assess their risk tolerance and make informed
  decisions.
6. Industry Standard:
The parametric VaR is an industry-standard risk measure used by financial institutions and corporations globally.
 It is well-established in the field of risk management and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, using this approach makes
  the analysis comparable with widely accepted practices in the industry.
7. Data-Driven Decision-Making:
The parametric VaR method uses historical data (mean and standard deviation) to estimate future risk. With reliable
 data, this method provides a quantitative measure of potential losses that is based on real-world performance, aiding
 in data-driven decision-making for portfolio management.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Standard Deviation (7%): The stock's returns fluctuate by 7%. For an investment of 100,000, this means the investor can
 expect the value of the portfolio to vary by about 7,000 up or down on average in a given period (one month). This
  reflects the volatility of the stock's returns.

Parametric VaR (-12%): With 95% confidence, the investor may face a loss greater than 12% of the portfolio value. For an
 investment of 100,000, this equates to a potential loss of 12,000. This represents the worst loss the investor can
  expect under normal market conditions, with a 95% probability.

Parametric Expected Shortfall (13%): In the worst 5% of scenarios (i.e., extreme events), the investor could face an
 average loss of 13% of their capital. This corresponds to a loss of 13,000. This measure is useful to understand the
  severity of the potential worst-case scenarios beyond the VaR.

EWMA Volatility (8.02%): The recent short-term volatility is 8.02%, meaning that, over the recent period, the portfolio
could fluctuate by 8,020 in value, indicating that the stock has had relatively high price movements recently.

REASON FOR CHOOSING EWMA Model

The EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) model was chosen for estimating volatility due to its simplicity,
computational efficiency, and suitability for situations where more recent data is expected to have a greater influence
on volatility estimation. Unlike more complex models like GARCH, EWMA does not require extensive parameter estimation
or large datasets, making it easier to implement and interpret. Additionally, since the data shows approximately
normal distribution and volatility tends to change over time, the EWMA model effectively captures these dynamics by
assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, prioritizing more recent market conditions. This
makes it a practical and efficient choice for real-time volatility estimation in this context.

Credit Risk

Altman Z-Score - 3.91

Analysis - An Altman Z-Score of 3.91 indicates that the company is in a "safe" zone, suggesting a low risk of
bankruptcy. The Z-Score measures financial health, and scores above 3 are typically considered strong, meaning the
company is financially stable and has a lower likelihood of distress. This score reflects a solid position with
respect to liquidity, profitability, and solvency.


 JUSTIFICATION OF CHOICE

Data Availability: Requires simple financial metrics that are readily available in company financial statements.
Ease of Use: The formula is straightforward and interpretable.
Industry Application: Particularly effective for assessing manufacturing and established firms.


The Altman Z-Score is used to assess credit risk by predicting a company's likelihood of bankruptcy. It's effective in
identifying financial distress and credit risk, especially for companies with publicly available financial data.
The Z-Score helps creditors, investors, and analysts make informed decisions by assessing key metrics like
profitability, liquidity, and leverage. A lower Z-Score indicates higher bankruptcy risk, making it crucial for
credit risk assessment, especially when evaluating companies’ financial health and potential for default.
