Justification for using Parametric Approach

1. Normal Distribution of Returns:
The Shapiro-Wilk test results show that the returns of the stock are normally distributed with a high p-value (0.6848),
 meaning there is no significant deviation from normality. Since the parametric VaR approach assumes that the underlying
  returns are normally distributed, this test result supports the use of the parametric method.
2. Simplicity and Computational Efficiency:
The parametric VaR method is one of the simplest and most computationally efficient techniques to calculate risk. By
 using the mean and standard deviation of returns, it avoids the complexity of more advanced techniques (such as Monte
  Carlo simulation or historical simulation). This makes it particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, and
   where the returns are approximately normally distributed, as is the case here.
3. Theoretical Foundation:
The parametric VaR method is grounded in statistical theory, specifically under the assumption that financial returns
are normally distributed. Since your returns passed the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, the theoretical assumption holds
 true, making the parametric approach an appropriate method for calculating risk in this scenario.
4. Risk Estimation:
The parametric approach provides an estimate of potential loss based on the mean, standard deviation, and the confidence
 level. These are key parameters in risk management, and the parametric method allows for a straightforward estimation
 of the risk of an asset or portfolio in normal market conditions. Given the normality of the returns, this method
  produces an accurate risk measure.
5. Interpretation of VaR:
The parametric VaR can be easily interpreted and is widely understood by risk managers. The calculation of VaR based on
a normal distribution allows for an intuitive understanding of risk—specifically, the potential loss in the worst case
scenario at a given confidence level. For example, at a 95% confidence level, the VaR tells us the amount we could lose
 with a 95% probability over a given time horizon. This helps investors assess their risk tolerance and make informed
  decisions.
6. Industry Standard:
The parametric VaR is an industry-standard risk measure used by financial institutions and corporations globally.
 It is well-established in the field of risk management and regulatory frameworks. Therefore, using this approach makes
  the analysis comparable with widely accepted practices in the industry.
7. Data-Driven Decision-Making:
The parametric VaR method uses historical data (mean and standard deviation) to estimate future risk. With reliable
 data, this method provides a quantitative measure of potential losses that is based on real-world performance, aiding
 in data-driven decision-making for portfolio management.

Mean Return:

This is the average return of the stock over the given period. In your case, it's 1.27%, which represents the average
 monthly return of the stock.
Standard Deviation:

The standard deviation of the returns is 0.07, which represents the volatility of the stock. A lower value indicates
 less variation in the stock's price changes over the period.
Parametric VaR (95% Confidence):

The Value at Risk (VaR) is 0.13, meaning there's a 95% confidence that the stock will not lose more than 0.13 (or 13%)
 of its value in a given month based on historical data.
Parametric Expected Shortfall (ES) (95% Confidence):

The Expected Shortfall (ES) is -0.14, meaning that in the worst 5% of cases, the average loss could be 14% of the
 stock's value. ES provides a deeper understanding of potential extreme losses beyond the VaR.
Beta:

Beta is 0.76, indicating that the stock is less volatile than the market (since the market beta is typically 1).
This suggests that the stock tends to move with less volatility compared to the broader index.

The latest EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) volatility estimate of 0.0802 indicates the most recent
estimate of the asset's volatility, with more weight given to recent data. This value reflects the asset's risk based
on recent price movements, using an exponentially decaying weighting scheme. The volatility estimate can be used for
risk management, such as in calculating Value-at-Risk (VaR) and adjusting portfolio allocations based on the latest
risk levels.


The Liquidity-Adjusted VaR (95% Confidence) of 0.15 indicates the potential loss, considering both market risk and
 liquidity risk, at a 95% confidence level over the given time horizon.

The Average Bid-Ask Spread of 343.86 represents the average difference between the buying and selling price for the
 asset, providing a measure of its liquidity.

The Liquidity Multiplier of 0.11 reflects the impact of liquidity on the asset's overall risk. A higher liquidity
multiplier would indicate a greater impact of liquidity risk, while a lower multiplier suggests a smaller effect.
The multiplier suggests that liquidity risk is contributing modestly to the overall risk of the asset.

REASON FOR CHOOSING EWMA Model

The EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) model was chosen for estimating volatility due to its simplicity,
computational efficiency, and suitability for situations where more recent data is expected to have a greater influence
on volatility estimation. Unlike more complex models like GARCH, EWMA does not require extensive parameter estimation
or large datasets, making it easier to implement and interpret. Additionally, since the data shows approximately
normal distribution and volatility tends to change over time, the EWMA model effectively captures these dynamics by
assigning exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, prioritizing more recent market conditions. This
makes it a practical and efficient choice for real-time volatility estimation in this context.

Credit Risk

Altman Z-Score - 3.91

Analysis - An Altman Z-Score of 3.91 indicates that the company is in a "safe" zone, suggesting a low risk of
bankruptcy. The Z-Score measures financial health, and scores above 3 are typically considered strong, meaning the
company is financially stable and has a lower likelihood of distress. This score reflects a solid position with
respect to liquidity, profitability, and solvency.


 JUSTIFICATION OF CHOICE

Data Availability: Requires simple financial metrics that are readily available in company financial statements.
Ease of Use: The formula is straightforward and interpretable.
Industry Application: Particularly effective for assessing manufacturing and established firms.


The Altman Z-Score is used to assess credit risk by predicting a company's likelihood of bankruptcy. It's effective in
identifying financial distress and credit risk, especially for companies with publicly available financial data.
The Z-Score helps creditors, investors, and analysts make informed decisions by assessing key metrics like
profitability, liquidity, and leverage. A lower Z-Score indicates higher bankruptcy risk, making it crucial for
credit risk assessment, especially when evaluating companies’ financial health and potential for default.
